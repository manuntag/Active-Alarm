# Active-Alarm
Active Alarm  challenges users to complete a set of mini games, in order to turn off the alarm

Activites are designed to encourage both mental and physical activity. 

####Mini Games include: 

Finding a moving character in a crowd

Completing a number of pushups 

Math Quiz that involves adding words rather than numbers (Ex. Twenty Five + Thrity Seven) 

####Features:

The user also has an option to include custom text when the alarm goes off (useful for daily reminders). 

The alarm uses Local notifications which allows the alarm to perform in the background and when the app is not currently running. 

Games are presented Modally and the only way to disarm the alarm is to complete the mini game
